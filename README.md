# Neural-Networks
Overview
The NeuralNetworkImplementation.ipynb notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to building and training neural networks using both TensorFlow's Keras API and a custom implementation from scratch using NumPy. It covers basic tensor operations, building simple neural network models for binary classification, and visualizing training performance.

Features
1. TensorFlow Keras Implementation
Model Definition: Builds a simple neural network with two dense layers for binary classification.

Compilation: Configures the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.

Training: Trains the model on the Iris dataset for binary classification (Setosa vs. others).

Visualization: Plots training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.

2. Custom Neural Network Implementation with NumPy
Neural Network Class: Defines a basic neural network class with methods for forward and backward propagation.

Training: Trains the network on a sample XOR dataset.

Error Visualization: Plots the total error over training epochs.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

tensorflow: For building and training neural networks using Keras.

numpy: For numerical computations and custom neural network implementation.

matplotlib: For plotting graphs.

sklearn: For loading the Iris dataset and splitting data into training and testing sets.

Installation
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage Instructions
Clone or download the notebook file to your local machine.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run all cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

Key Sections
TensorFlow Keras Model
Model Architecture:

Two dense layers with ReLU activation in the hidden layer and sigmoid activation in the output layer.

Example:

python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu', input_shape=(x_train.shape[1],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
Compilation:

Optimizer: Adam.

Loss: Mean Squared Error.

Metrics: Accuracy.

Example:

python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['accuracy'])
Training:

Trains the model on the Iris dataset for binary classification.

Example:

python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_test,y_test))
Visualization:

Plots training and validation loss and accuracy.

Example:

python
plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'])
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.show()
Custom Neural Network Implementation
Neural Network Class:

Defines a basic neural network with two hidden layers.

Methods for forward and backward propagation.

Example:

python
class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.weights1_input_hidden = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.weights2_hidden_output = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
Training:

Trains the network on a sample XOR dataset.

Example:

python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for input_vector, target in zip(X, y):
        nn.forward_propagation(input_vector)
        nn.backward_propagation(input_vector, target)
Error Visualization:

Plots the total error over training epochs.

Example:

python
plt.plot(epoch_range, errors)
plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.ylabel('error')
plt.show()
Observations
The Keras model demonstrates how to build and train a simple neural network for binary classification.

The custom NumPy implementation shows how to create a neural network from scratch, including forward and backward propagation.

Future Improvements
Deep Learning Architectures: Explore more complex architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Optimization Techniques: Implement regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, L1/L2 regularization) to improve model performance.

Advanced Activation Functions: Experiment with different activation functions (e.g., Leaky ReLU, Swish) in the custom implementation.
